# AutomationFramework

CODING ASSIGNMENT\
General guidance: The goal is not to produce a fully functional framework with exhaustive test cases, but rather to gauge architectural and coding skills. Choose a set of test cases that you feel are representative of those you would include in a full solution.

Assignment #1 - Create a test suite using any language / UI automation framework that you're comfortable with that searches Google for "Ducks". Write any tests that you see fit that would demonstrate how you would verify that ducks were properly searched for.

Version 1: 

Assignment #2 - Create a test suite using Javascript that you would like that performs requests on 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', and validates the functionality. Write tests that demonstrate how you would approach verifying the response. --> NOTE: you do not need to be an expert in Javascript, best effort is excellent
